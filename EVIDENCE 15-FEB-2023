Pros: High level historical Data     Cons: Regular Maintenance                Pros: Dynamic, automatic, interactive     Cons: Labor intensive
      Easy to Design                       less Visuallly appealing                 More stakeholder access                   Can be confusing 
      less labor intensive                                                          low maintenance                           potential unclean data

      Pivot Table:
      It is a data summarizing tool during data processing. It summerize, sort, reorganize, group, count, total or average data stored in database.
      
      
DATA VS METRICS
METRICS: Single, quantifiable types of data that can be used for measurements.
         usually involve simple math
         retension rate of customer also use merics
         It is a great way to understand Data.
         
Different Company or industry use Different Matrices 
Like ROI (Return on Investment) which help understand how is the investmnet going which is calculated as net profit over time by cost of investment.

METRIC GOAL: It is a measurable goal set by company and evaluate using metrics.

DASHBOARD 3 TYPES:
1. Operational Dashboard:           Provides real-time KPIs for day-to-day decision-making and management.
2. Tactical/Analytical Dashboard:   Provides detailed insights into specific areas of the business to identify patterns and opportunities for improvement.
3. Strategic Dashboard:             Provides a high-level view of the organization's overall performance and progress towards long-term goals.

In practice, these types of dashboards are not mutually exclusive, and many dashboards may include elements of all three. The key is to design a 
dashboard that meets the specific needs of the users and provides actionable insights that help drive business success.


MATHEMATICAL THINKING
Mathematical thinking is a problem-solving approach that involves using logic and mathematical reasoning to analyze and solve complex problems, 
and it can help develop critical thinking skills and improve decision-making abilities.
- Break things down into smaller sections and find relationshiops or pattern among them in logical way.
- Also help identify what tool to use because it provide wider aspects of the problems like if dataset is small than we might use spreadsheet and if 
  dataset is large, we might use SQL.
