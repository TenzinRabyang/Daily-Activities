Toady I stared my Google Data Analytics Course 2 which discussed more in depth about second phase of Data Analysis called "ASK" where Data Analyst ask effective questions
to solve business problems. 
* Introduction to the problem-solving and Effective questioning 
* Spreadsheet basic in depth 
* Effective Communication 
* Structure Thinking: The process of recognizing current problems or situations, organizing information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options.



DATA IN ACTION
* Marketing analytics is the process of measuring, analyzing, and managing a companyâ€™s marketing strategy and budget.
* ASK and zoom out to understand whole context and root problem not the symptoms.
* Collaborate with stakeholder to confirm business questions and issue.
