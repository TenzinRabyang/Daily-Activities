STRUCTURE THINKING
- The process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available informations, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying options.

- Save Time, Resources, Money

PROBLEM DOMAIN
- One of the first thing to do as Data Analyst is to understand the Problem Domain completely 
- Problem Domain is the specific area of analysis that encompass every activity affecting or effected by the problem.

SCOPE OF WORK (SOW)
- Agree upon outline of the work you're going to perform on a project.
- The scope of work is a critical component of any project or task, and it outlines the specific tasks, deliverables, 
   and objectives that must be accomplished to successfully complete the project.
   
WHY SOW?
- Sets clear expectations and objectives
- Defines project boundaries to prevent scope creep
- Helps with project planning and resource allocation
- Facilitates communication among project stakeholders
- Enables monitoring and control of project progress.

What is a good SOW?
1. Deliverables: What work is being done, and what things are being created as a result of this project? When the project is complete,
    what are you expected to deliver to the stakeholders? Be specific here. Will you collect data for this project? How much, or for how long?   

2. Milestones: This is closely related to your timeline. What are the major milestones for progress in your project? How do you know when a given 
   part of the project is considered complete? 
   
3. Timeline: Your timeline will be closely tied to the milestones you create for your project. The timeline is a way of mapping expectations for how 
   long each step of the process should take. The timeline should be specific enough to help all involved decide if a project is on schedule. When will 
   the deliverables be completed? How long do you expect the project will take to complete? If all goes as planned, how long do you expect each component 
   of the project will take? When can we expect to reach each milestone?
   
4. Reports: Good SOWs also set boundaries for how and when youâ€™ll give status updates to stakeholders. How will you communicate progress with stakeholders 
   and sponsors, and how often? Will progress be reported weekly? Monthly? When milestones are completed? What information will status reports contain?
