COUNTIF is an example of a function that returns a value based on a 
condition that the data range is evaluated for. The function counts the 
number of cells that meet the criteria. For example, in an expense 
spreadsheet, use COUNTIF to count the number of cells that contain 
a reimbursement for "airfare."
